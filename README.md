# Next Commerce Developer Docs

Developer documentation for the Next Commerce platform, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app).

This repo powers the public developer docs site, including:

- product docs for Campaigns, Storefront, Apps, and Webhooks
- generated Admin API, Campaigns API, and GraphQL reference docs
- the docs homepage and shared MDX components

## Repository Layout

- `content/docs/` - authored MDX docs and sidebar metadata
- `content/docs/admin-api/`, `content/docs/campaigns/`, `content/docs/webhooks/`, `content/docs/storefront/graphql/` - generated reference docs
- `app/` - Next.js app shell, homepage, layout, sitemap, and favicon
- `components/` - shared MDX, page, and UI components
- `scripts/` - doc generators and link validation
- `public/` - logos, icons, and generated API specs

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the docs site locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

`dev` runs the doc generators first, then starts Next.js with Turbopack.

Preview a production build locally by serving the `out/` directory with any static file server after `npm run build`.

## Content Workflow

- Edit authored docs in `content/docs/`
- Update section ordering and navigation with the relevant `meta.json` files
- Use `content/docs/admin-api/`, `content/docs/campaigns/`, and `content/docs/webhooks/` for generated API reference content
- Use `content/docs/storefront/graphql/` for generated GraphQL reference content

The generated reference docs are created automatically by:

- `npm run generate-api-docs`
- `npm run generate-graphql-docs`

Those scripts are already wired into `npm run dev` and `npm run build`.

## Validation

Check for broken internal links:

```bash
npm run validate-links
```

## Deployment

The site is built as a static export. Netlify runs `npm run build` and publishes the `out/` directory.

## Search

Site search is powered by Algolia DocSearch. The search index is updated automatically on pushes to `main` through GitHub Actions.
