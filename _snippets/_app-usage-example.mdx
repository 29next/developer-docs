In the example below, our app uses `my-app.js` to add custom funcationality on the storefront that should be loaded on every page of the store.


```shell title="Example App Structure"
your-app
 ├── assets
 │   └──  my-app.js
 ├── snippets
 │   └──  global-footer.html
 └── manifest.json
```

In order to add `my-app.js` to every page of the store, we'll add it to a snippet that uses the `app_asset_url` tag to reference the file source in a script tag.


```django title="Example Asset Usage in Snippet"
<script src=="{% app_asset_url 'assets/my-app.js' %}"></script>
```

:::caution
All assets are loaded from a CDN which does not support local file imports from another file. It's a best practice to compile and minify your assets into self contained single files.
:::


In order to configure the snippet to load into a theme `app_hook` we'll add it to the app manifest `locations:storefront` configured with the desired location.

```json title="Example Manifest.json"
{
  "locations": {
    "storefront": {
      "global_footer": "snippets/global-footer.html",
    }
  }
}
```

Once you've done this, you should now see that `my-app.js` is being loaded on every page on the storefront globally in the footer. :clap:
