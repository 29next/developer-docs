# Admin API

### Getting Started

At the core of 29 Next is the Admin API.

```mdx-code-block

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

<Link
    className="button button--primary button--lg"
    to="/docs/api/admin/reference/">
    See Admin API Reference
</Link>

```

### Authentication


The Admin API uses Oauth 2 authorization protocol to manage access to your store's resources. Oauth Apps (and associated access tokens) can be tailored with object-level permission to ensure that each integrated service only has access to necessary objects.

Before using the Admin API, you'll need to create a store and create an OAuth App necessary for API access. To create an OAuth App, navigate to **Settings > API Access** and create a new Oauth App with applicable [permissions](permissions.md) to retrieve your **Access Token**.  It is recommended to create unique Oauth Apps per external system so that you can revoke as needed.

```shell title="Admin API Path"
https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/
```


**Use your Oauth App Access Token in the request headers to access the API.**

```shell title="Example Request"
curl -X GET "https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <api access token>" \
-H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"
```

### Versioning

API versioning allows 29 Next to continuously evolve the platform while maintaining predictable behavior for existing APIs with a path for upgrades and deprecations.

**Admin API Versions**

| Version | Status | Docs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `2023-02-10` | Stable | [View Reference](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2023-02-10) |
| `2024-04-01` | Release Candidate | [View Reference](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01) |
| `unstable` | Unstable | [View Reference](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=unstable) |


**Specify an API Version**

To specify a version, pass the `X-29Next-Api-Version` header with your desired API version.

:::warning
It is **highly recommended** to specify your version on your API requests to ensure consistency for your integration.

### Rate Limits

Admin APIs are rate-limited to maintain the stability and equity of our platform for all users. We employ a number of methods to enforce rate limits.

| API | Rate Limit Method | Limit |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Admin API | Request-based | 4 requests/second |

:::info
Once you reach API rate limits you'll then receive a 429 Too Many Requests response, and a message that a throttle has been applied.
:::


We recommend API users to appropriately limit calls, cache results, and retry requests using strategies that are considered industry best practices,to avoid hitting getting rate limit errors
