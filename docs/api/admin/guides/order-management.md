Order management operations can be automated through the Admin API for more efficient operations and bulk actions on large quanities of orders.

Below are best practices and guides for common scenarios merchants and partners use to manage orders on the Admin API.


### Order Items Editing

Editing items on an order is common practice, such as swapping products purchased for a different size or color with the same value without needing to collect payment or create a refund. 

:::info Only Available on 2024-04-01 API Version
Order editing APIs are only available on 2024-04-01 API Version and above, if you are still using older versions we recommend you upgrade your integration.

Order editing APIs also do not affect order payment within each request. To remove items with an associated refund, see [order refunds](#order-refunds). Using order edit APIs can result in the customer owing or the merchant owing to the customer.
:::

#### Line Item Quantities Explained

Order line items have 4 quantity attributes that represent quantities at different states in an order life cycle. 

 - `quantity` - Item quantity total ever added to the order in this line.
 - `current_quantity` - Current item quantity that have not yet been removed.
 - `fulfillable_quantity` - Item quantity that have not yet been fulfilled, such as a partial fulfillment.
 - `editable_quantity` - Item quantity that currently can be edited.

```json title="Line Item Quantities Explained"
"lines": [
  {
    ...
    "quantity": 3, // quantity of items ever added
    "current_quantity": 2, // current quantity that have not been removed
    "fulfillable_quantity": 1, // quantity that have not yet been fulfilled 
    "editable_quantity": 1, // quantity that can be edited
    ...
  }
]
```

### Swap Items Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    lines: Retrieve Order Lines
    removeLine: Remove Unwanted Items
    addLine: Add New Items
    collectPayment: Collect Payment
    lines --> removeLine
    removeLine --> addLine
    addLine --> collectPayment
```

Swapping Items on an order is a 4 step process:

1. Retrieve order line items using the [ordersRetrieve](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRetrieve) endpoint and check `editable_quantity` is > 0.
2. Update/Remove line items using the [ordersLinesPartialUpdate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesPartialUpdate) or [ordersLinesDestroy](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesDestroy) endpoint.
3. Create new line item [ordersLinesCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesCreate) endpoint. 
4.  [Collect payment for an outstanding](#collect-payment-for-outstanding-balance) balance using the [ordersCollectPaymentCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersCollectPaymentCreate) endpoint.


#### Update Existing Line Item

Below is an example API call to change the quantity of a line item to 1. If the existing quantity was 2, this would remove 1 quantity, can also be used to increase line item quantity. This endpoint only accepts quantity changes, to change the product or price, see [ordersLinesCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesCreate) endpoint. 

```json title="Update Existing Line Item"
// PATCH https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/lines/{lineID}/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "quantity": 1, // change quantity to 1
  "reason": "product swap" // optional
}
```

#### Remove Full Line Item

Below is an example DELETE request to the [ordersLinesDestroy](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesDestroy) endpoint to remove a line item. 

```json title="Remove Line Item"
// DELETE https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/lines/{lineID}/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"
```


:::info Check Line Item Editable Quantity
Line items have `editable_quantity` which represents the item quantity not already in process of being fulfilled, already fulfilled, or  already removed from the order. 

**If `editable_quantity` is `0`, the line item cannot be edited.**
:::


#### Create New Line Item

Below is an example POST request to the [ordersLinesCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersLinesCreate) endpoint to create a new line item. 

```json title="Create New Line Item"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/lines/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "product_id": 184,
  "quantity": 1,
  "price": 89.99, // optional
  "reason": "product swap" // optional
}
```

#### Collect Payment for Outstanding Balance 

Orders can have an outstanding balance owed by the customer as a result of changing items on the order. To collect the outstanding balance, use the [ordersCollectPaymentCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersCollectPaymentCreate) endpoint to initate a payment transaction with the order's initial payment method. 

```json title="Collect Payment for Outstanding Balance"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/collect-payment/ 
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "send_payment_notification": true // optionally send notificaiton to customer 
}
```

### Order Refunds

Order management actions that require refunding and removing items from an order can be done through the refund flow. The refund flow is espcially useful when creating partial refunds or creating refunds for items that have already shipped to the customer.

#### Refund Flow
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    lines: Retrieve Order Lines
    calculate: Calculate Refund
    refundCreate: Create Refund
    lines --> calculate
    calculate --> refundCreate
```

Refunding specific items of an order is a 3-step process:
1. Retreive order line items using the [ordersRetrieve](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRetrieve) endpoint.
2. Calculate the refund using the [ordersRefundCalculateCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRefundCalculateCreate) endpoint.
3. Create the refund using the [ordersRefundCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRefundCreate) endpoint.


:::info
Order Refund Calculate APIs are only available on `2024-04-01` version and newer. See [API Versioning](/docs/api/admin/#versioning) for how to specify a version in your requests.
:::

#### Retreieve Order Lines

Below is an abreviated example request to [ordersRetrieve](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRetrieve) endpoint to get the line items of the order.

```json title="Retrieve Order Details"
// GET https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": 1000, // order line item
      "quantity": 3, // quantity in the order
      "current_quantity": 3 // quantity available and not yet removed from the order
    }
  ]
}
```
:::caution Order Payments Must Be Captured
Order payments must be captured in order to create partial refunds, uncaptured payments cannot be partially refunded.
:::

#### Calculate Refund

Call the [ordersRefundCalculateCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRefundCalculateCreate) endpoint with your line items to calculate the refund and see which initial payment transactions will be refunded.

```json title="Refund Calculate Request"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/refund/calculate/
{
  "refund_lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1000, // line item we want to refund
      "quantity": 1 // quantity to refund
    }
  ],
  "refund_shipping": {
    "full_refund": false, // set true to fully refund shipping
    "amount_excl_tax": "3.99"
  }
}
```
Below is the response from the [ordersRefundCalculateCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRefundCalculateCreate)  API that has been slightly abbreviated to focus on the relevant refund items.

```json title="Refund Calculate Response"
{
  "refund_lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1000, // line item being refunded
      "quantity": 1, // number of items being refunded

  "amount_incl_tax": "63.98", // total amount incl to be refunded
  "total_tax": "0.00", // total tax being refunded
  "currency": "USD"
}
```


#### Create Refund

We're now ready to create a refund using the [ordersRefundCreate](/docs/api/admin/reference/?v=2024-04-01#/operations/ordersRefundCreate) endpoint, see request details below.

```json title="Order Create Refund Request"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/refund/
{
  "note": "Example reason for the refund",
  "refund_lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1000, // line item being refunded
      "quantity": 1, // number of items being refunded
      "restock_type": "no_restock", // restock action (from calculate step)
    }
  ],
  "refund_shipping": {
    "amount_excl_tax": "3.99",
    "full_refund": false
  },
  "send_refund_notification": true, // send refund email notification to customer
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": 1000,  // transaction id to refund (from calculate step)
      "amount": "63.98" // amount to refund to this transaction (from calculate step)
    }
  ]
}
```
:::info Restock Actions
Depending on the product type and status of the line items being refunded, there are differen't restock actions available.

**Physical Product**
- If unfulfilled, restock_type must be `cancel`.
- If fullfilled, restock_type can be `return` or `no_restock`.

**Digital Product**
- If unfulfilled, restock_type must be `cancel`.
- If fulfilled, restock_type must be `no_restock`.

### Update Shipping Address

Updating an order shipping address is a common task that can be done with a PATCH request to the [ordersUpdate](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/ordersUpdate) endpoint.


```json title="Update Order Shipping Address"
// PATCH https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/orders/{number}/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "shipping_address": {
    "line1": "4765 Test Lane West", // new shipping address line 1
    "line4": "Mountain Pass", // new shipping address city
    "state": "CA", // new shipping address state
    "postcode": "92366", // new shipping address postcode
    "country": "US" // new shipping address country
  }
}
```
:::info Before Fulfillment Processing

Updating an order shipping address should be done **before** the order is sent to a fulfillment location for fulfillment. If the order has already been accepted and processing, send a a [cancellationRequestSend](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/cancellationRequestSend) request and then [fulfillmentRequestSend](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/fulfillmentRequestSend) after you've updated the shipping address. 
:::


### Request Fulfillment

Fulfillment can be requested immediately through the [fulfillmentRequestSend](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/fulfillmentRequestSend) for cases that you'd like to immediately send the fulfillment order to the fulfillment location for fulfillment. 


```json title="Fulfillment Request"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/fulfillment-orders/{id}/fulfillment-request/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "fulfillment_order_line_items": [  // will split the fulfillment order into a new fulfillment order
    {
      "id": 0,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "message": "Special message to warehouse", // message to the fulfillment location
  "notify": true // notify the customer when fulfillment order is fulfilled
}
```

### Hold Fulfillment

Holding fulfillment for an order while waiting for additional review or making adments to the order before sending to the fulfillment location for shipping.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    retrieveFulfillmentOrders: Retrieve Fulfillment Orders
    sendFulfillmentCancelRequest: Send Fulfillment Cancel Request
    retrieveFulfillmentOrders --> sendFulfillmentCancelRequest
```
1. Retrieve all fulfillment Orders using the [ordersFulfillmentOrdersRetrieve](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/ordersFulfillmentOrdersRetrieve) endpoint.
2. Send a [fulfillmentOrdersHold](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/fulfillmentOrdersHold) request for each fulfillment order to hold.

```json title="Hold Fulfillment Order Request"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/fulfillment-orders/{id}/hold/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "reason": "address_incorrect", // see available reasons in api reference
  "reason_message": "Additional relevant detail." // provide additional relevant detail
}
```

### Cancel Fulfillment

Canceling a fulfillment order that is already accepted and processing with a fuflillment location is a common order management task to stop fulfillment or as a prerequisite step to moving a fulfillment order to a new location. 

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    retrieveFulfillmentOrders: Retrieve Fulfillment Orders
    sendFulfillmentCancelRequest: Send Fulfillment Cancel Request
    retrieveFulfillmentOrders --> sendFulfillmentCancelRequest
```

1. Retrieve all fulfillment Orders using the [ordersFulfillmentOrdersRetrieve](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/ordersFulfillmentOrdersRetrieve) endpoint.
2. Send a [cancellationRequestSend](/docs/api/admin/reference/#/operations/cancellationRequestSend) request for each fulfillment order to request fulfillment cancellation.


```json titl="Fulfillment Order Cancellation Request"
// POST https://{store}.29next.store/api/admin/fulfillment-orders/{id}/cancellation-request/
// -H "Authorization: Bearer <API ACCESS TOKEN>" -H "X-29Next-Api-Version: 2024-04-01"

{
  "message": "Reason why canceling fulfillment" // message sent to the fulfillment location regarding the cancellation
}
```

### Move Fulfillment Orders
