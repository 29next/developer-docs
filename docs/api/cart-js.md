# Cart JS API

:::warning Deprecated
Carts JS API is now deprecated and will be removed in the future. You can use the Storefront GraphQL API directly with JS in your theme.

You can find the Storefront GraphQL API at `https://{storedomain}/api/graphql/`
:::


Leverage the integrated JS API to add turn-key functionality to buttons in your storefront and funnels.

The 29 Next Cart JS API allows you to create HTML buttons that carry a variety of functionalities, with no extra code required.  See below for examples and methods of implementation.

### Button Actions

To add products to a cart, there are data attributes that can be used on an HTML <button></button> to integrate it with the storefront cart.

| Data Attribute | Required | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| data-action="add-product"  | Yes | Action of the button |
| data-stockrecord-id=1 | Yes | Stockrecord ID corresponding to the Product SKU and Currency you want to add to the cart. |
| data-quantity="1,1" | Yes | Quantity of the product to add |
| data-interval="day, one-time" | No | Subscription interval, supports day, week, month, year, day is recommended. The second product is one-time. |
| data-interval-count="30, one-time" | No | Subscription interval count, numeric, 30 when combined with subscription interval would be "30 days". The second product will be added as a one time purchase. |
| data-redirect=false | No | Whether to redirect to next page in funnel flow after adding product to cart, default is true. |
| data-voucher="VOUCHERCODE" | No | Apply voucher code to basket after adding the products. |
| data-product-remove="1,22" | No | Product IDs to remove from the basket in the case of doing a product swap. |
| data-product-remove-quantity="1,1" | No | Quantity of products to remove from the basket in the case of doing a product swap.|
| data-product-remove-interval="week, one-time" | No | Subscription interval of product to remove from the basket, follows same logic as when adding.|
| data-product-remove-interval-count="6, one-time" | No | Subscription interval count of product to remove from the basket, follows same logic as when adding. |
| data-clear-cart=true | No | Clear the existing products in the cart before adding more products. Helps with situations where you want to clear existing products for an upsell. |

### Example Add to Cart Buttons

```html title="Add multiple one time products"

<button type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-block"
    data-action="add-product"
    data-stockrecord-id="4,6"
    data-quantity="1,1">
    Add Combo
</button>
```
```html title="Add a product on subscription every 30 days"
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success"
    data-action="add-product"
    data-stockrecord-id="9"
    data-quantity="1"
    data-interval="day"
    data-interval-count="30"
    data-voucher="VOUCHERCODE">
    Add Subscription
</button>

```

### Apply Voucher Form
This form gives the ability for a customer to apply a voucher (coupon) to their basket from within the page body, instead of via the UI in the sidecart.  This can also be combined with the `applyVoucherToBasket` callback event to customize the success display.
``` html title="Apply Voucher Form"
<div data-form="voucher-form" class="input-group mb-3">
   <input type="text" class="form-control" name="voucher_code" placeholder="Voucher Code">
   <button type="button" class="btn btn-info"
   data-action="apply-voucher">
   Add Voucher
   </button>
</div>
```
### Show the Cart

To show the contents of the cart to the user, 29 Next has a built in cart template that can show the current cart count, and trigger the cart modal with HTML attributes.  See example below.

| Attribute | Action |
|-------|-------|
|href="#basket-modal" data-toggle="modal"| Used to trigger the cart modal|
|id="basket-count"|Use to display the current cart count|
|id="basket-subtotal"|Use to display basket sub total|


``` html title="Show Cart Example"
<a class="btn btn-default py-2 d-md-inline-block"
    href="#basket-modal" data-toggle="side-cart">
    Cart <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" data-basket-count></span>
    | <span data-basket-subtotal></span>
</a>
```

#### Callbacks

Use callback methods to listen for events and extend and enhance the UX.

``` html title="Add Product Callback"
<script>
    $(function() {
        funnel.callback.on('addProductToBasket', function(data) {
            console.log("product added");
            console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
        });
    });
</script>
```

```html title="Add Voucher Success Callback"
<script>
    $(function() {
        funnel.callback.on('applyVoucherToBasket', function(data) {
            console.log("voucher applied");
            console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
        });
    });
</script>
```

``` html title="Show & Hide Side Cart"
<script>
    $(function() {
        funnel.callback.on('addProductToBasket', function(data) {
            $("#basket-modal").cart('show'); // Show the Side Cart
        });
    });
</script>
```
