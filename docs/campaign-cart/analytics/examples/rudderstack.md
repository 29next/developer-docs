title: RudderStack Setup
description: Integrate RudderStack with Segment-compatible event tracking.
---


RudderStack is a Segment-compatible analytics platform that tracks customer events and collects product data. This integration maps SDK events to RudderStack's Segment specification.

## Setup

1. **Add RudderStack Snippet**

   Add the RudderStack tracking snippet to your HTML `<head>` section. You'll need to replace `YOUR_WRITE_KEY` and `YOUR_DATA_PLANE_URL` with your actual RudderStack credentials:

   ```html
   <script>
   rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics=[];for(var methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId"],i=0;i<methods.length;i++){var method=methods[i];rudderanalytics[method]=function(a){return function(){rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))}}(method)}rudderanalytics.load("YOUR_WRITE_KEY","YOUR_DATA_PLANE_URL"),rudderanalytics.page();
   </script>
   <script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
   ```

   **Getting Your Credentials:**
   - Log in to your RudderStack dashboard
   - Navigate to Workspace Settings → Data Plane URLs
   - Copy your Write Key and Data Plane URL
   - Replace the placeholders in the snippet above

2. **Enable in SDK Config**

   Configure the RudderStack provider in your analytics configuration:

   ```javascript
   analytics: {
     providers: {
       rudderstack: {
         enabled: true,
         blockedEvents: []  // Optional: array of event names to exclude
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Configuration Options:**
   - `enabled` (boolean): Enable or disable RudderStack tracking
   - `blockedEvents` (array): List of SDK event names to exclude from RudderStack (useful for filtering sensitive events)



## Event Mapping

RudderStack events follow the Segment specification. The SDK automatically maps your e-commerce events to their RudderStack equivalents:

| SDK Event | RudderStack Event | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `dl_add_to_cart` | `Product Added` | Fired when a product is added to the shopping cart |
| `dl_remove_from_cart` | `Product Removed` | Fired when a product is removed from the shopping cart |
| `dl_view_item` | `Product Viewed` | Fired when a product detail page is viewed |
| `dl_view_item_list` | `Product List Viewed` | Fired when a product list or category page is viewed |
| `dl_view_cart` | `Cart Viewed` | Fired when the shopping cart is viewed |
| `dl_begin_checkout` | `Checkout Started` | Fired when the checkout process is initiated |
| `dl_add_shipping_info` | `Checkout Step Completed` | Fired when shipping information is entered |
| `dl_add_payment_info` | `Payment Info Entered` | Fired when payment information is provided |
| `dl_purchase` | `Order Completed` | Fired when an order is successfully completed |

## Product Format

Products are automatically converted to the Segment specification format. Each product in your events will be transformed to include these standardized properties:

```javascript
{
  product_id: 'SKU-123',
  sku: 'SKU-123',
  name: 'Product Name',
  price: 99.99,
  quantity: 1,
  category: 'Category',
  brand: 'Brand',
  variant: 'Variant',
  position: 0,
  url: 'https://example.com/product/sku-123'
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for the product (same as SKU)
- `sku`: Stock Keeping Unit
- `name`: Product display name
- `price`: Product price in decimal format
- `quantity`: Number of units
- `category`: Product category
- `brand`: Product brand
- `variant`: Product variant or size
- `position`: Position in product list (0-indexed)
- `url`: Product page URL

## Features

### Identify Calls

The SDK sends `identify()` calls with user data when user information is available. This includes:
- User profile tracking
- Cross-device identification
- Demographic data collection
- User trait enrichment

### Page Calls

The SDK triggers `page()` calls on route changes to:
- Track page views and navigation patterns
- Segment user journeys
- Analyze user flow through your application

### Additional Capabilities

- Product metadata included in tracking calls
- Campaign source and attribution tracking
- Session tracking across user interactions
- Revenue and conversion metrics

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

```javascript
analytics: {
  providers: {
    rudderstack: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```javascript
analytics: {
  providers: {
    rudderstack: {
      enabled: true,
      blockedEvents: [
        'dl_custom_internal_event',
        'dl_debug_event'
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment-Based Configuration

```javascript
analytics: {
  providers: {
    rudderstack: {
      enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      blockedEvents: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['dl_debug_event'] : []
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Appearing in RudderStack

**Check Your Setup:**
1. Verify the RudderStack snippet is loaded in your `<head>` section
2. Ensure your Write Key and Data Plane URL are correct
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (open Developer Tools)
4. Confirm RudderStack is enabled in your SDK configuration

**Debug with Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Check if RudderStack is loaded
console.log(window.rudderanalytics);

// Manually trigger a test event
rudderanalytics.track('Test Event', { test: true });
```

### Write Key or Data Plane URL Issues

**Symptoms:** Events fail silently or "401 Unauthorized" errors appear

**Solution:**
1. Verify credentials in your RudderStack dashboard
2. Ensure your Data Plane URL is complete (include protocol, e.g., `https://`)
3. Check that your workspace is active
4. Generate a new Write Key if the current one seems compromised

### Blocked Events Not Working

**Symptoms:** Events you want to exclude still appear in RudderStack

**Solution:**
1. Verify the event name exactly matches your blockedEvents array
2. Check that the configuration is properly loaded before events fire
3. Event names are case-sensitive: `dl_add_to_cart` ≠ `dl_AddToCart`

### Product Data Missing

**Symptoms:** Product events reach RudderStack but lack properties

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your product objects include required fields: `product_id`, `name`, `price`
2. Check that product data is properly formatted in your event payloads
3. Verify no custom product field mapping is conflicting

### Performance Issues

**Optimization Tips:**
1. Use `blockedEvents` to exclude high-frequency internal events
2. Load the RudderStack script asynchronously
3. Consider batching events if sending large volumes
4. Review RudderStack's destination list and disable unused integrations
