# Storefront API

A rich Storefront Graphql API is available for theme and app developers to extend and customize the customer experience.

### Reference Docs

The Storefront API reference documentation is available at `https://<storedomain>/api/graphql/` with the familiar GraphiQL IDE.

### Use Cases

Storefront API is most commonly used to control the current user's cart with available mutations such as `creatCart`, `addCartLines`, `removeCartLines`. See the `/api/graphql/` on your store for all available queries and mutations.


:::info
The Storefront API is currently only available within the context of the storefront on a storefront domain, external access will be available in future iterations.
